//----------------Vital Sign Panel----------------

EntryElement:	VitalSignsPanel
Based on:	NonLaboratoryObservation
Description: "A summary of vital signs, including weight, height (or length), blood pressure, respiration rate, oxygen saturation, heart rate, and body temperature, BMI, and (optionally) head circumference. Each member of the panel is treated as a separate, independent observation. The panel is a grouping for convenience so all vitals can be retrieved using one LOINC code (85353-1)."
		Code is LNC#85353-1 "Vital signs, weight, height, head circumference, oxygen saturation and BMI panel"
