<p>
  This is a preliminary version of the Standard Health Record Core Module Implementation Guide, based on Health Level 7 (HL7) Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR).<br/>
</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
The goal of the Standard Health Record (SHR) Collaborative is to provide a high quality, computable source of patient information by establishing FHIR implementation guides (IG) in a number of high-impact clinical areas. SHR has an explicit goal of promoting semantic interoperability by creating horizontally consistent IGs that share common data structures and profiles. This goal is realized though unique distributed modeling environment and tooling that allows multiple projects to share the same basic logical model framework, which is then automatically converted into FHIR.</p>
<p>SHR standards are intended to encourage and facilitate reliable and repeatable collection and aggregation of a wide range of patient-focused data. Through the SHR, we realize greater transparency, empowerment, and clinical interoperability that supports patients, caregivers, clinicians, researchers, scientists, and public health organizations.</p>

<h2>The SHR Core Module</h2>
<p>
SHR core module ("shr-core") is the basis for all SHR-based profiles and implementation guides. It contains class definitions that are used across all the clinically-focused modules. The SHR-core model can be described as object-oriented version of FHIR. It contains class definitions, closely aligned to FHIR, but in a class hierarchy that allows inheritance, specialization, extension, and introduction of constraints, all aligned to the expressive capabilities of FHIR profiles. But - SHR core provides the power of abstraction
  

</p>

This Implementation Guide defines FHIR profiles, extensions, value sets, and code systems necessary to implement other SHR IGs. This version is based on FHIR 3.0.1 (a.k.a. STU3).

<h3>Known Issues and Limitations</h3>
<p>
  HL7 FHIR and the Standard Health Record Collaborative are continually evolving works-in-progress.  These
  profiles use FHIR 3.0.1 (a.k.a. STU3), which is a pre-cursor to the final FHIR Normative release.  The content
  of the profiles is based on the latest SHR data element definitions as of the publish date. HL7 FHIR, the SHR,
  and the SHR HL7 FHIR Profiles will all continue to evolve.
</p>
<p>
  The following are known issues and limitations as these specifications continue to evolve:
  <ul>
    <li>These profiles are not yet fully compatibile with US-Core.  Future versions will improve compatibility,
      with the goal that data conforming to SHR profiles will also conform to corresponding US-Core profiles.</li>
    <li>These profiles are generated from formal SHR data element definitions and mappings.  While it is a goal
      to explicitly map every SHR-defined entry element to FHIR, a small number have not yet been mapped and are
      temporarily profiled on FHIR's Basic resource.
    <li>The terminology server used to expand value sets does not support all value sets and code systems used by
      SHR.  Value set documentation will indicate when this occurs.</li>
    <li>The Implementation Guide publisher incorrectly renders some characters and links, occasionally causing
      broken links to external content.  This is a known bug in the FHIR IG publishing tool.</li>
    <li>In some cases, deeply nested SHR data elements are not fully represented in detail in FHIR profiles.
      While the core data is always represented, there are ongoing discussions to determine how best to represent
      the more detailed qualifying elements of deeply nested structures.</li>
  </ul>
