<h1><a name="genomics"></a>Genomics Reporting</h1>

<p>Cancer genomics is the study of the totality of DNA sequence and gene expression differences between tumor cells and normal host cells. It aims to understand the genetic basis of tumor cell proliferation and the evolution of the cancer genome under mutation and selection by the body environment, the immune system and therapeutic interventions (source: <a href="https://www.nature.com/subjects/cancer-genomics">Nature</a>).</p>
<p>mCODE includes the minimal set of genetic related elements relevant to capture in an EHR to inform cancer assessment and  treatment options. mCode's genetic-related elements align with levels 1 and 2 of the HL7 ClinicalGenomics Working Group's (CGWG) tiered framework of adoption since these are most relevant to cancer assessment and treatment. This is illustrated in the diagram below:</p>

<p>mCODE at this time is loosely based on <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/genomics.html">HL7 CGWG Clinical Genomics Reporting Implementation Guide.</a></p>

<h3><i>Genetic Test Identifiers</i></h3>
<p>mCODE allows for different coding systems like the Logical Observation Identifiers and Names (LOINC) and local codes to specify the genomics test or panel provided that a the coding system or ID convention is specified.  While <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gtr/">Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)</a> is currently the best source for identifying genetic tests, the user should be aware that the GTR cannot be a sole reliable source since the test data is voluntarily updated and there is no overarching data steward. Standardization of codes for genetic tests is essential to facilitate data analysis of genetic tests, and should be a priority for the genomics testing community in the near future.</p>
