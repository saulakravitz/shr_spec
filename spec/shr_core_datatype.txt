Element:		BodyLocation
Description:	"A location or structure in the body, including tissues, regions, cavities, and spaces; for example, right elbow, or left ventricle of the heart. Body location is a flexible structure that allows the location to be determined by a single code, or a code plus laterality and/or orientation. The body location can also be specified in relation to one or more body landmarks. SNOMED CT is used in all cases. 
+ Code only: The code should include (precoordinate) laterality and/orientation to the degree necessary to completely specify the body location.
+ Code plus laterality and/or orientation: The basic code augmented by codes specifying the body side and/or anatomical orientation.
+ Relation to landmark: The location relative to a landmark is specified by:
    - Establishing the location and type of landmark using a body site code and optional laterality/orientation, and 
	- Specifying the direction and distance from the landmark to the body location. 
Note that BodyLocation is a data type, a reusable structure, not a stand-alone entity. The concept is similar to how a postal address can apply to a person, location, or organization. This contrasts with FHIR's stand-alone BodySite (aka BodyStructure in r4) which 'is not ... intended for describing the type of anatomical location but rather a specific body site on a specific patient' (FHIR 3.5)."

	Element:		Laterality
	Description:	"Body side of the body location, if needed to distinguish from a similar location on the other side of the body. 

	The laterality element is part of BodyLocation, a flexible structure that allows the location to be determined by a single code, or a code plus laterality and/or orientation. The body location can also be specified in relation to one or more body landmarks. SNOMED CT is used in all cases. 

	+ Code only: The code should include (precoordinate) laterality and/orientation to the degree necessary to completely specify the body location.
	+ Code plus laterality and/or orientation: The basic code augmented by codes specifying the body side and/or anatomical orientation.
	+ Relation to landmark: The location relative to a landmark is specified by:
		- Establishing the location and type of landmark using a body site code and optional laterality/orientation, and 
		- Specifying the direction and distance from the landmark to the body location. 

	Note that BodyLocation is a data type (a reusable structure), not a stand-alone entity. The concept is similar to how a postal address can apply to a person, location, or organization. This contrasts with FHIR's stand-alone BodySite (aka BodyStructure in r4) which 'is not ... intended for describing the type of anatomical location but rather a specific body site on a specific patient' (FHIR 3.5)."

	Element:		RelationToLandmark
	Description:	"The relationship between a landmark that helps determine a body location and the body location itself. The location relative to a landmark is specified by:
