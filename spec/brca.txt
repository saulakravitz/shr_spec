Parent:            CodedObservationComponent
Description:       "The degree of mitotic activity in breast carcinoma is one component of the Nottingham histologic grade, which is a prognostic indicator for patients with breast carcinoma. Mitotic activity is assessed as the number of mitoses per 10 high power fields (HPF), with increasing mitotic activity being an indicator of more aggressive cancer. The specific scores assigned to the number of mitoses depends on the size of the HPF. For example, for a HPF size of 0.274 mm^2, less than 10 mitoses per 10 HPF gets a score of 1, 10-19 gets a score of 2, and greater than or equal to 20 gets a score of 3. When larger or smaller HPFs are used, the cutoffs for the number of mitoses corresponding to a specific score are adjusted according to published guidelines."

Description:       "The Oncotype DX test for invasive breast cancer examines the activity of 21 genes in a patient’s breast tumor tissue to provide personalized information for tailoring treatment based on the biology of their individual disease. The value from 0 to 100 indicates the estimated risk of recurrence, with the highest risk indicated by a score greater than 31.
No LOINC code currently exists for this test. We are seeking feedback on the value of separating OncotypeDx scores for DCIS and invasive breast carcinomas. Does it make more sense to report the OncotypeDx as a single score, regardless of the type of cancer?"
