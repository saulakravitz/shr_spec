Mitotic activity is assessed as the number of mitoses per 10 high power fields (HPF), with increasing mitotic activity being an indicator of more aggressive cancer. The specific scores assigned to the number of mitoses depends on the size of the HPF. For example, for a HPF size of 0.274 mm^2, less than 10 mitoses per 10 HPF gets a score of 1, 10-19 gets a score of 2, and greater than or equal to 20 gets a score of 3.

	Element: 		Ki-67LabelingIndex
	Based on:		SimpleCodedObservation		
	Concept:		MTH#C4049944
	Description:	"Ki-67 is a protein phosphatase whose expression is strongly associated with cell proliferation and encoded by the MKI67 gene. The Ki67 labeling index is the fraction of Ki-67-positive cells to total cells in a tumor specimen and may be useful for determining prognosis with respect to survival and disease recurrence. The more positive cells there are, the more quickly they are dividing and forming new cells.	ReferenceRange: Low <10, Intermediate 10-20, >20 High"
	Value:		 	Quantity with units UCUM#%
					Code is LNC#29593-1
					Components.ObservationComponent
	includes 0..1	PrimaryAntibody  //from Ki67AntibodyVS if covered

	Element:		S-PhaseFraction
	Based on:		SimpleCodedObservation
	Concept:		MTH#C0812425
	Description: "An expression of the number of mitoses found in a stated number of cells. The S-phase fraction number tells you what percentage of cells in the tissue sample are in the process of copying their genetic information (DNA). This S-phase, short for synthesis phase, happens just before a cell divides into two new cells. ReferenceRange: Low <6, Intermediate 6-10, >10 High."
	Value:			Quantity with units UCUM#%
					Code is LNC#29593-1

includes 0..1	Refseq

			Element:		Refseq
			Based on:		ObservationComponent
						Description:	"The Reference Sequence (RefSeq) collection provides a comprehensive, integrated, non-redundant, well-annotated set of sequences, including genomic DNA, transcripts, and proteins. RefSeq sequences form a foundation for medical, functional, and diversity studies. They provide a stable reference for genome annotation, gene identification and characterization, mutation and polymorphism analysis (especially RefSeqGene records), expression studies, and comparative analyses."
